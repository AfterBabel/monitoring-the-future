Two general types of tasks may be\n distinguished. The first is to provide a systematic and accurate\n description of the youth population of interest in a given year, and\n to quantify the direction and rate of change occurring over time. The\n second task, more analytic than descriptive, involves the explanation\n of the relationships and trends observed. Each year, a large,\n nationally representative sample of high school seniors in the United\n States is asked to respond to approximately 100 drug-use and\n demographic questions as well as to an average of 200 additional\n questions on a variety of subjects, including attitudes toward\n government, social institutions, race relations, changing roles for\n women, educational aspirations, occupational aims, and marital and\n family plans. The students are randomly assigned one of six\n questionnaires, each with a different subset of topical questions but\n all containing a set of \"core\" questions on demographics and drug\nuse.
